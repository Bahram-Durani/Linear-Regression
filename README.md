<h2 style ="font-family:Comic Sans MS;" align = "center">Linear-Regression</h2>

Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

Before you attempt to perform linear regression, you need to make sure that your data can be analyzed using this procedure. Your data must pass through certain required assumptions.

1. The variables should be measured at a continuous level. Examples of continuous variables are time, sales, weight and test scores. 
2. Use a scatterplot to find out quickly if there is a linear relationship between those two variables.
3. The observations should be independent of each other (that is, there should be no dependency).
4. Your data should have no significant outliers. 
5. Check for homoscedasticity â€” a statistical concept in which the variances along the best-fit linear-regression line remain similar all through that line.
6. The residuals (errors) of the best-fit regression line follow normal distribution.
